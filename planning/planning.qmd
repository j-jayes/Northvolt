## Context

Northvolt, established in 2016 in Stockholm, Sweden, is a battery manufacturing company focused on producing sustainable lithium-ion batteries. Its goal is to create the world's greenest batteries, emphasizing recycling and minimizing the carbon footprint. Northvolt's key facility, *Northvolt Ett*, is located in Skellefteå, northern Sweden, and is central to its production operations. This site also hosts *Revolt Ett*, a plant dedicated to recycling critical battery materials, aiming to support a fully integrated circular battery production system【6†source】【7†source】.

In terms of recent developments, Northvolt has faced significant financial and operational challenges. The company secured a $5 billion loan earlier this year to expand its *Northvolt Ett* factory, but the planned expansion was recently put on hold due to economic pressures and changing market conditions. This has led to a reduction in workforce, with 1,600 jobs cut, impacting Sweden's labor market【6†source】【7†source】. Additionally, Northvolt's subsidiary responsible for the expansion project filed for bankruptcy, adding to the company's struggles【9†source】.

Despite these challenges, Northvolt remains a key player in the global push for electrification and aims to ramp up production to meet commitments with major automakers like BMW, Scania, and Volvo【7†source】【9†source】.
